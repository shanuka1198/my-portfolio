                                I pursued a degree in Accounting and Finance at NSBM Green University,
                                where I gained a strong foundation in financial management, auditing,
                                and corporate accounting. The program enhanced my analytical and problem-solving skills,
                                while also providing hands-on experience with financial modeling and reporting.
                                Through coursework and practical projects, I developed a deep understanding of business operations,
                                investment strategies, and financial decision-making. This academic journey has equipped
                                me with the knowledge and confidence to excel in dynamic and challenging financial environments.
